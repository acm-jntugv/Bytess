        <h2 class="sub-heading">Introdution</h2>
        
        <p>Planning is important in everyday life especially in business
            can plan based on the previous market history but if there
            is not a steady growth in the business, then then they
            have to leave the outdated planning approach and go for
            an intelligent planning approach through the machine
            learning algorithms. Intelligent Planning with machine
            learning helps the managers to give frequent updates
            on the next possible outcomes. The planning types are
            discussed here.
            Planning is determining the sequence of action to achieve
            the goal Planning is the process of making correct
            decision to achieve the desired goal.
            Planning in Business: In business plans has to change so
            quickly to survive in the present market condition. The
            main challenges the company faces is to change the plan
            frequently with respect to the real time environment. The
            distance between the planning and taking action should
            be zero in terms of months, days, and hours.</p>
            <p><b>Logistics supply</b></p>
            <p>This is supplying the right product to
                the right person. The time consumed for gathering the
                information and analysing the information is taken care
                by the machine-learning model. This can also help
                in recurring planning when and then needed by the
                organisation. It reduces the time for planning.</p>
            <p><b>Resource Planning</b></p>
            <p>It is the way of identifying the
                resources and their needs</p>
            <p><b>Data Security</b></p>
            <p>The problems faced in this digital
                transformation is the malware. The machine-learning
                model will help to predict the malware file. The ML
                algorithms can also report anomalies and helps to predict
                security breaches.</p>
            <p><b>Improved Customer Experience</b></p>
            <p>The ML technology will
                recognise the userâ€™s behaviour patterns. It keeps track
                of the routine work by analysis with more quickly and
                accurately than a human analyst.</p>
            <p><b>Powerful prediction ability</b></p>
            <p>Business will get a more
                accurate forecasting capability by incorporating the
                machine learning models into the data analytics.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Planning and Decision-making</h2>
        <p>Planning is the task of getting the sequence of action to
            achieve the goal. While decision-making is the sequence
            of action that sill transform the state in a step-by-step
            manner and satisfies the goal.
            Planning can be classified as Offline and online planning 
            <p>offline planning will not receive the feedback about the
            current state. Ex. Crane and Robot</p>
            <p>The online planning needs the feedback about the
            execution status. Ex.Autonomous Vehicle</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Planning with AI and RL through Robot</h2>
        <p>Robot interacts with the surroundings using the above
            features listed in the Figure 3. sensing allows robot to
            collect the information. This can be achieved through
            the cameras, microphones etc., Perception allows the
            robot to perceived and reason about the surrounding
            environment. Cognition is the intelligent behaviour of a
            robot to learn and reason about the how to behave. By
            doing the action, the robot changes the state. The robot
            interact with the outside world.
            The intelligent planning will help the business to do a
            forward-looking analytics and helps them to anticipate
            the business growth. Intelligent planning with machine learning provides guidance to the business
            managers about next possible solutions and
            outcomes.</p>
