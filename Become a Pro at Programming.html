        <p>In the era of continuous digitization in the software industry, it is important for students to learn coding and to focus on improving their programming skills. I remember the day when I started to do coding. I was at a loss as to where to begin and which language to use. I want to share a few things that can make you a good programmer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>The first thing to do to start coding is to choose a programming language. The C language helps you learn the basics of programming. It will provide you with a thorough understanding of how to code. After knowing about the basic concepts, you can easily switch to any other programming language. It will help if you learn multiple languages like procedural, object-oriented, etc., but the focus should be on developing logic and not the language.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Practicing Coding</h2>
        <p>Then start practicing coding on any of the coding platforms like HackerRank, CodeChef, LeetCode, etc. I prefer LeetCode because it is more user-friendly and allows us to easily track our progress. The feature of streaking helps with consistency.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Learning and Problem Solving</h2>
        <p>Learn the basics first, and after getting strong with the basics, move on to data structures and algorithms. Learn all the basic data structures like array, list, tree, graph, trie, etc. Try to understand where to use which data structure and the time complexity of those data structures. Learn all the basic and advanced algorithms for sorting, searching, dynamic programming, backtracking, etc., and their complexity computations. Learning STL libraries will aid in reducing the time required to code the entire logic as well as the code length.</p>
        <p>Try to solve easy questions first and then move on to medium-level problems topic-wise. Solve similar problems that use the same logic. Try to write the code on your own. Even though it takes a lot of time, it increases problem-solving skills. You will gain confidence once the code has been accepted. Debugging the code will help you see where the code went wrong. Hence, debugging is always a good practice. After you’ve solved the problem, go to the discussion section. You will get a lot more approaches to solving the same problem. See the optimal solution for it. Always progress from brute force to better to optimal. Even if you have written the naive solution, it is important to understand the time and space complexities and the optimal solution.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Consistency and Practice</h2>
        <p>Another suggestion is to keep track of the codes you’ve solved, the algorithms you’ve learned, and everything else you’ve learned. It helps you review the things you have learned. One of the best practices is to write comments for the code you have written so that when you come back, you can recollect the logic you have written, which might also help the people who want to understand your thought process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Participate in Contests</h2>
        <p>Participate in as many contests as you can on various coding platforms. At first, you might be able to solve only one problem, but with continuous practice, you can definitely solve all the problems one day. Contests develop your competitive programming skills. They make you fast and increase your ability to think deeply about a problem. Join coding clubs if possible. Maintain coding profiles and do a minimum of 200 problems on any of those platforms and should also have good contest history. It will let recruiters know that you are good at programming and are consistent. The ratio of problems solved must be 1:2:1 for easy, medium, and hard.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Stay Consistent</h2>
        <p>Consistency is the key to success. It is important to solve problems every day in order to improve your problem-solving skills. If consistency is not present, you forget what you have learned, especially in coding. You might have to start from the beginning in order to keep the same pace. Set goals and deadlines to increase productivity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Collaboration and Learning</h2>
        <p>Sharing solutions to problems accelerates the development of your thought process. Try teaching what you’ve learned to others to help you remember it longer and to generate new ideas. Do pair programming. It will improve your problem-solving skills as we code in front of others and observe other programmers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Have faith in yourself and learn continuously.</p>
