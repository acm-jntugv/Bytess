        <p>Landing the job you want isn’t always a straightforward process. Everything from spellbinding your resume to exhilarating your interviewers can be challenging and completely nerve-racking. Top companies not only look for people who work hard but people with a positive attitude. Always come up with a great story that speaks to your dedication, hard work and perseverance. And you’ve heard it before, because it’s true: “Communication is key”, always try to be proactive and express your interest, this mantra will definitely place you in great hands. Being a fresher, you need to get your foot in the door. A generic resume isn’t likely going to do it, no matter how polished it looks. So make sure it lines up with the job description, because any communication to the hiring managers should be very clear in a way you’re a fit for the role. Finally, are you juggling around the interview process? Here is the life saver: “Always make coding your priority”. There are many platforms available to enhance your coding skills like Leetcode, HackerRank etc. You can’t just go with the last few days of preparation to companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Your learning should be a continuous process. The better you are with your core knowledge, the best you will get. Speaking out your thoughts to interviewers makes a big difference. Sometimes you might not solve the problem as expected but might end up with a job. Sounds weird right? But it’s true. These days all top companies are looking not only for problem solving skills, but also expect you to communicate your thoughts. Remember, they mainly focus on your approach to the problem which can be achieved only by putting your thoughts out. Your best bet to improve your skills is collaborative programming using shared environments in real-time with your friend or colleague by sharing each other’s thoughts and solving problems together. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t solve it in the first go. Keep trying, the more the merrier. It always takes hard work to achieve something important.
