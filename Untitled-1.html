        <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>Let me ask a simple question to readers… “Do you know
            how much data you are creating on daily?” You may
            answer “Hey!! I don’t know. But I am using one mobile,
            one laptop, one smart watch, etc…..”. You are right. Many
            of us don’t know how much data each we are creating
            individually or socially. In one research demonstrating
            that each individual is handling nearly 8 devices. Many of
            social networks are collecting our information through
            their web sites and apps etc… This is amazing to see our
            historical data.
            
            We cannot separate ourselves from gadgets where
            gadgets are serving human needs. What about the data?
            Which we are collecting on each second. I found that
            https://www.ancestry.com/, the genealogy site, stores
            around 2.5 petabytes of data.​The Internet Archive stores
            around 2 petabytes of data and is growing at a rate of
            20 terabytes per month. Ecommerce companies are
            collecting click data is unpredictable quantity. All above
            statistics are tentative my analysis 3yeare back!!!!
            
            
            Now you may understand we need some one to handle
            all this data effectively and provide you as and when you
            need this data. There BIGDATA come in to light. Bigdata is having 5V’s of characteristics are Volume, Velocity,
            Variety, Veracity, Value.

            <p>A person should have vision to make his carrier in

            <p>This is something depending on level of competency.
                
                Under my training with above minimum knowledge
                person triggered his carrier in a 6 months by spending

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Basics of big data:</h2>
        
        <p>
            Bigdata can be stored in Hadoop Distributed File
System(HDFS), cloud based storage system etc… . Let
us discuss in this article on HDFS. HDFS stored data can
be operated multiple ways through various frameworks.
More familiar industrial usage are Hadoop and Spark.

            </p>
            
            <p><b>Hadoop</b>is a framework which is written in Java that can
                handle with large cluster of commodity hardware to store
                large size data with expandable hardware facilities. Hadoop
                will work on “MapReduce Programming Algorithm” which
                was introduced by Google.
                Hadoop can work with various languages most familiar
                are Hive Query Language(hql), pig scripting language,
                impala, hBase, java
                
            </p>                
                
            
                <p><b>Spark</b>is a framework which a free source from Apache.

                    You can read Bigdata Characteristics in detail on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/5-vs-of-big-data/
                    You can learn more on HDFS at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hadoop-architecture/</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Architectural Comparison:</h2>
<p>Spark can handle Historical data like Hadoop and near
    real time data which will help data scientist to make
    quick business decisions. Spark will work with in process
    memory leads 10 times faster than Hadoop.
    Spark framework supports variety of languages like
    python, java, scala, sql, R, et…

        <p>The negative impact of the physical distancing restrictions
            of COVID-19 lockdowns is well known – access to
            healthcare, employment, education, etc., was severely
            affected, particularly for those with limited access to the
            internet for remote solutions. However, the rise in digital
            tools has meant that some efforts could be made to reach
            low-income communities through customized methods.
            Home-learning programs using feature phones5 and
            content delivered through IVRS messages helped engage
            students to a certain extent, as did access to healthcare,
            including mental health specialists, through online services
            and chatbots.

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Required hardware:</h2>
    <p>For practice, you can use your pc as single node cluster
        and interact with components. Processor should be
        superior that i5, RAM-16GB & above, SDD/HDD 500gb or
        greater will make effective.
    </p>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Required software:</h2>
    <p>All Apache software are free source. You can preliminary
        install cloudera quick start, VM Work station, 7zip. You can
        install other software on SOS basis.
    </p>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Sequence of learning:</h2>
    <p>After once install all software, you can start learning
        with various data sets. Components learning sequence
        suggested are MapReduce -> MapReduce with Java ->
        hive -> pig -> sqoop -> impala -> flume -> solr -> hue ->
        oozie -> spark & its components.
