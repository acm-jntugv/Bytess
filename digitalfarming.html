            <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>As India is mostly an agriculture-based country, recent development and proliferation of advanced technologies is taking India to a greater height in agriculture sector. Old days are gone where farmers had to put lot of effort in their daily
                activities of crop production and selling. In recent days, we can hardly name few areas where Machine learning (ML), blockchain and IOT are not being used. Indeed, these technologies are omnipresent. Machine learning algorithms can analyse
                data collected from sensors and drones on the farm, such as weather patterns, soil moisture, and crop health, to help farmers make more informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. It can also be used to analyse
                data on foodborne illness outbreaks and predict potential risks. ML algorithms can analyse data on weather patterns and crop yields to help insurance companies better predict risks and set premiums.</p>
            <p>When it comes to security aspects, Blockchain can be used to securely store this data, ensuring its integrity and preventing tampering. It can also be used to track the journey of crops from farm to consumer, allowing for greater transparency
                and traceability. After the outbreak and prediction of potential risks is being made by the ML models, Blockchain tracks the source of contaminated food, allowing for more targeted recalls and reducing the risk of widespread outbreaks.
                It can store different types of data provided to it, ensuring its integrity and preventing fraud.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, the integration of machine learning and blockchain can help farmers make more informed decisions, reduce waste and inefficiency in the supply chain, and improve food safety and sustainability. IoT sensors can collect data on different
                factors including soil moisture, temperature, road condition, financial transaction, etc. Which helps in passing these several types of data to the ML model to solve real-life problems.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">IoT in Smart Agriculture</h2>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of real-world things such as machinery, cars, buildings, and other physical objects that are equipped with sensors, software, and network connectivity. IoT sensors can be used in agriculture to track
                environmental variables including humidity, temperature, and soil moisture. Farmers may get real-time data and use it to optimize crop output by deploying IoT devices. For instance, farmers can immediately water the crops if the data indicates
                that the soil is too dry, lowering the chance of crop loss due to drought.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Soil monitoring:</b> IoT sensors may be used to track soil moisture, pH, and nutrient levels, which enables farmers to make better decisions about irrigation and fertilisation. IoT sensors can be buried in the ground to track important
                        soil characteristics like moisture content and nutrient levels. Farmers can receive real-time information about the condition of their soil by connecting these sensors to a network that gathers and analyses the data. Using this
                        knowledge, farmers may modify their fertilisation and irrigation methods to make sure that crops get the ideal balance of nutrients and water. This not only results in better crops but also has the potential to reduce water and
                        fertiliser waste, improving the sustainability and profitability of farming.

                        <b>Weather monitoring:</b> Farmers can use IoT devices to gather information about weather patterns to assist them plan their planting, harvesting, and other farming activities. The weather has a significant impact on agricultural
                        productivity. Real-time data regarding temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and other weather variables can be gathered with IoT devices. Following that, farmers can utilise this information to make knowledgeable choices
                        regarding planting, harvesting, and other farming operations. Farmers can utilise weather information, for instance, to choose the optimum time to grow crops or the best time to use pesticides or fertilisers. Farmers who have access
                        to the most recent weather data can make better decisions that will increase the quality of their crops while lowering the risks connected with weatherrelated problems like drought and flooding.

            <p>In conclusion, incorporating IoT, ML, and blockchain in smart agriculture can offer a number of advantages to farmers, consumers, and other industry players. ML algorithms may analyze this data to produce insights and make data-driven decisions
                regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control by employing IoT sensors to gather information about crop status, weather, and other variables. A tamper-proof and transparent log of all transactions can be created by storing this
                data on a blockchain, enhancing supply chain traceability and transparency. The supply chain can be automated through the use of smart contracts, and stakeholders can benefit from the increased efficiency and sustainability of smart agriculture.</p>
