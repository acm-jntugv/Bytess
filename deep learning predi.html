    <p>High-quality software is in high demand in today’s
        developing technology. This is because people rely on
        software for every task. But the current software has
        become more complex and costly to develop. For this
        reason, there is still trouble with low quality at larger
        economic costs. To solve this problem we take an
        approach i.e Software Defect prediction that can improve
        the quality of software effectively.
        Have you ever thought about how we can identify faultprone areas in a large amount of data? This can be done
        through statement-wise detection of the error which
        involves methods like Data Pre-processing, Neural
        Networks, Random Forest, etc where the data undergoes
        training, testing, and cross-validation to remove any fault
        in the statement and using performance metrics we can
        calculate the accuracy of the model.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction to SLDeep Model:
        </h2>
        <p>This model uses deep learning techniques to find a solution
            to problems faced by software developers. Initially, we
            use Data Pre-processing where one needs to compute
            metric data then extract the tokens, and later construct
            a matrix for the given program. By doing this we perform
            statement-wise observation of our data and clean data to
            prepare it for undergoing training and testing where the
            most important models i.e Neural Network and Random
            forest are used.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Neural Network:</h2>
        
        <p>
            We know that the Neural Network model is an effective
Machine learning technique and mainly LSTM that belongs
to the Recurrent Neural Network family. We use LSTM as
it has self-loops with several layers and nodes that can
flow for longer durations. This model memorizes the
code structure as a sequence of statements thus helpful
to observe data and make more informed decisions.

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Random Forest:</h2>
<p>However, we can also use the Random Forest technique
    which is a tree-based model that uses multiple decision
    trees to make decisions. While we train the data the model
    uses these decision trees and takes an average of all the
    values to improve the predictive accuracy of the data i.e
    greater the number of trees greater will be the accuracy
    and prevents over-fitting. Therefore the errors in the data
    are minimized substantially.
    Finally perform K-fold cross-validation which is a strategy
    applied to the parameters, where the action reiterates k
    times for running the same algorithm on data. Each time
    it uses the fold as a test set and validates the model. Later
    averages the score at every stage.
    The quality of the software after using this model can
    be identified using performance measures. They tend to
    evaluate the effectiveness of the SLDeep i.e accuracy,
    precision, recall, and f-measure. Using training and
    testing accuracy graphs we can approximately estimate
    the working efficiency of the model.

        <p>
            It is every organization’s basic necessity to have highquality software to perform complex tasks and monitor
            errors at a faster rate, the Software Defect Prediction
            model gives the flexibility to pinpoint the errors in a huge
            amount of data with less time and less effort. This model
            can be used on programs in different application domains
            i.e Android Applications, defining metrics from C-based
            languages, etc.
