        <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>Applications for machine learning (ML) and data science
            (DS) that have been successfully implemented have
            enabled businesses to use creative business models and
            opened new prospects. On the other hand, companies
            using ML and DS solutions are at significant risk of failure
            and can quickly fail to meet their goals, according to
            research reports (Dabrowski, 2021). Therefore, adopting
            or adapting a project management approach to ML and
            DS applications’ unique requirements is crucial. Agile
            Project Management (APM) could be suggested as a
            remedy result. However, a dearth of research takes an
            agile approach to ML and DS project management.
            The complicated projects that are often completed by ML
            and DS teams include a variety of tasks from the knowledge
            areas of system engineering, software engineering (SE),
            and data engineering. System engineering, software
            engineering, and data engineering positions are among
            the most prevalent in projects. However, they can
            vary and largely depend on the project management
            techniques the teams use. It is significant to highlight that
            both ML and DS projects have project stakeholders, users,
            business analysts, system analysts, data scientists, and
            data engineers (Ransbotham et al., 2017).

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Understanding Agile Project Management (APM):
        </h2>
        <p>Transparency, client focus, flexibility, ownership,
            effective leadership, and continuous development are
            the key characteristics of agile processes in the project
            management knowledge domain. Therefore, project
            management activities must follow this collection of
            agile principles to be agile. APM is an iterative method
            of developing software that emphasizes the creation of
            usable software with achievable tasks in short iterations.
            In addition, it highly values constant customer feedback
            and communication, enthusiastic cooperation, and rapid
            responses to modifications or new requirements.</p>
        <p>The
            values listed in the Agile Manifesto (2001) are as follows:
            </p>
        <p>“1.Individuals and interactions over processes and
            tools,”
            
            </p>
        <p>“2.Working
            software
            documentation,”
            </p>
        <p>“3.Customer collaboration over contract negotiation,”
        </p>
        <p>“4.Responding to change over following a plan,”
        </p>
        <p>Based on their team structure, release dates, daily Business
            as Usual (BAU) duties, and organizational architecture,
            companies employ Scrum, Kanban, Data-Driven Scrum
            (DDS), and Team Data Science Process (TDSP) to execute
            this agile technique in a project. Saltz et al. (2017)
            conducted a controlled experiment to compare the ML
            & DS teams’ use of Scrum, Kanban, and standard project
            management techniques. The obstacles faced by the
            Scrum teams were task estimates, data comprehension,
            and customer needs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Scrum:</h2>
    <p>The three primary roles in Scrum are Product Owner,
        Scrum Master, and Development Team. One of the most
        well-liked agile software development techniques is
        Scrum. It uses an incremental and iterative development
        strategy and cycles to arrange the total effort (Sutherland
        and Schwaber, 2017). Sprint cycles are time-boxed, have
        fixed objectives, and run between two and six weeks.</p>
    <p>All the software development activities are included in
        each Sprint. The product features are chosen from the
        product backlog and added to the sprint backlog during
        the first activity, the sprint planning meeting. During
        the execution phase of a sprint, a goal is attained. Short
        Stand-up Meetings are held to check on the daily status
        of the project. The inspect-and-adapt activities include
        the Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective Meetings,
        which are held toward the conclusion of the Sprint. In the
        Sprint Review, the recently developed product increment
        is evaluated and presented to the project stakeholders.</p>
    <p>The Sprint Retrospective examines the Scrum methods
        utilized to produce the product, whereas the Sprint Review
        concentrates on the product deliverables and the product
        itself.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Kanban:</h2>
        <p>Lean thinking and just-in-time scheduling are closely
            related to the straightforward project management
            technique known as Kanban. Roles and process structure
            are not precisely specified; however, meetings can be
            scheduled as needed (Brechner, 2015). If their process
            models adhere to the Kanban principles, teams can adopt
            them. The fundamentals include using a task board,
            visualizing the workflow, limiting the amount of work in
            progress, monitoring, and controlling the flow by putting
            rapid feedback loops into place. To prevent bottlenecks,
            Kanban balances the workload needs with the team’s
            capability to maximize value and decrease waste.
            </p>

        
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Application of Agile Methodology:
        </h2>
        <p>It is feasible to adapt APM following corporate demands
            or the needs of DS and ML projects while embracing agile
            principles. The setting of DS and ML initiatives, company
            culture, and team members’ individual experiences all play
            a role in this. Brasjo and Lindovsky (2019) state that ML
            projects have employed various adaptations of CRIS-DM,
            Scrum, Kanban, and TDSP. Lean Kanban and Scrum-like
            iterations are combined in Saltz, and Sutherland’s (2019)
            proposed process model to make it more organized and
            repeatable. Agile is an approach that encourages ongoing
            learning and development. The future of business is driven
            by DS and ML initiatives, with Agile as the backbone to
            support successful delivery and ongoing improvement in
            ML/DS project lifecycles (see Figure 1). The key areas for
            implementing agile in ML/DS are to show progress and
            value and pursue improvement with clarity.
            
            For ML and DS projects employing sprint-based Scrum,
            estimating what can be accomplished in a sprint may
            be a severe problem. Included in a fixed-length sprint
            may include unrelated and irrational backlog items. For
            instance, more or fewer items from the backlog may be
            needed for exploratory data analysis or model evaluation.
            </p>
        <p>As a result, spring lengths must be adjustable following
            the demands of ML or DS testing techniques. However,
            Kanban does not discuss project responsibilities, standards
            unique to a particular process, tools, or strategies. This
            arrangement could provide the teams with the freedom
            and allow them to utilize their customized process
            models. However, it might also lead to misunderstanding
            and ambiguity, leading to more implementation issues
            (Brechner, 2015).
            
            
            
            Plan-driven approaches may be selected for projects
            with predictable activities and procedures and wellunderstood and attainable project objectives. In contrast,
            utilizing solely agile methods may not be appropriate for
            large systems with interdependent components, such as
            Scrum/Kanban as depicted in Figure 2. Simply adopting
            a plan-driven methodology may be rigid or inflexible.
            Hybrid approaches still have several shortcomings,
            notwithstanding the possibility of contributions. First,
            no formal standards, theoretical foundation, or practical
            context exist for developing hybrid approaches to meet
            the specific needs of DS and ML projects. The difficulties
            and problems that affect the success of agile and hybrid
            projects, for instance, are presented by Sithambaram
            et al. (2021), who classify them into four categories:
            organization, people, process, and technology.
            
            
            
            The findings of a case study on SE difficulties for ML
            and AI projects are presented in a research study done
            by a Microsoft team. Considering this, data finding and
            management may be considerably more challenging
            and complex than other SE processes. Reusing and
            customizing models calls for abilities beyond those of SE
            teams. ML modules could be trickier than conventional
            software modules since SE, ML, and AI modules might be
            intertwined in various sophisticated ways. Teams frequently
            worry about automating procedures like data aggregation,
            synthesizing, feature extraction, and pipeline. Additionally,
            combining ML development with software development
            infrastructure would speed up the experiments.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Popular AI subfields include machine learning (ML)
        and data science (DS), which have created new
        business models and provided creative solutions to
        various practice area difficulties. There are several facts
        concerning ML and DS initiatives failing and producing
        disappointing outcomes, even though they might
        significantly influence businesses. Adopting or adapting
        APM strategies to ML and DS applications’ unique needs
        has been a significant contributing element. The project
        management techniques that are recognizable to or
        appealing to organizations are those used in the SE field.
        Despite sharing many key characteristics, none of the
        APM approaches is widely used in ML and DS. Scruminspired techniques are still used for ML and DS projects.
        However, the biggest disadvantages are the difficulty
        with job estimates and the set length of sprints. Setting
        up manual or automated data or machine learning
        pipelines is a significant barrier for fixed-length iterative
        development cycles like Scrum. For ML and DS projects,
        process-specific rules, tools, and strategies are not
        provided by Kanban, even though it may be seen as
        more adaptable and more straightforward than the other
        APM methodologies. With its high-level task estimations,
        decoupled meetings from iterations, and capability-based
        executions, DDS, a relatively new methodology, may
        address Scrum’s shortcomings. Another frequent problem
        for ML, DS, and SE teams is automating the software engineering, data collection, synthesizing,
        feature extraction, and pipeline operations.
