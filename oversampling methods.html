    <p>Software defect prediction (SDP) is essential to analyze and identify defects present in a software
        model in the early stages of software development. The identification of these defects and their early
        removal provides cost-efficient software. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been successfully
        used for developing defect prediction models. However, these techniques deliver off-target results
        when implemented on imbalanced datasets. For example, a dataset with unequal class distribution is
        technically imbalanced. Thus, ML techniques on such imbalanced data lead to a biased prediction of
        minority class instances, which are more important than majority class instances. Therefore, the
        imbalanced data problem must be resolved to successfully develop an efficient SDP model. A study on
        “Efficiency of oversampling methods for enhancing software defect prediction by using imbalanced data”
        evaluated the prediction capability of ML classifiers for software defect prediction on nine imbalanced
        NASA datasets by applying oversampling methods. A set of five oversampling methods were considered
        to synthesize minority class instances and make the datasets balanced. These oversampling techniques
        replicated or synthesized the instances of minority classes to balance the datasets. When the datasets
        were balanced, ML classifiers were used to develop a defect prediction model. The experimental results
        acquired by applying ML classifiers on the imbalanced and balanced data showed an enhancement in
        the learning capability of ML techniques with the implementation of sampling techniques. Oversampling
        methods considerably improved the prediction performance of the ML classifiers.

        <p>The development of software systems is the driving force
            of the modern world. Nowadays, software is being used in
            all fields. High-quality software with excellent performance
            is required to achieve a competitive edge in the market.
            With major digital transformations of organizations,
            software-based innovation and development expand
            rapidly, which results in balancing value delivery at a high
            speed without sacrificing quality. However, this balance
            cannot be easily attained. In most organizations, software
            quality lags behind other objectives. Quality negligence
            leads to a drawback, which is reported in this NIST report.
            Although organizations can monetize the business value
            of speed, they rarely measure the offsetting cost of poor
            quality. In 2020, the total cost of poor software quality
            (CPSQ) in the U.S. was $2.08 trillion (T). Moreover, a NIST
            report indicated the U.S. figure for 2020 for the technical
            software debt of severe defects that require correction
            to be $1.31 T (without interest); however, this report
            did not include technical debt for total CPSQ because
            it represents an increasing future cost (14% increase
            since 2018). Software defect prediction assists software
            practitioners in efficiently allocating test resources,
            to predict potentially defective modules in a software
            product. Several machine learning (ML) techniques
            have been proposed for software defect prediction;
            however, no common consensus regarding dominant
            classifiers is available. Thus, designing a reliable defect
            prediction model remains challenging. Software defect
            prediction (SDP) models are used to analyze and identify
            defective modules present in the software. These models
            predict whether a software module is prone to defects.
            In software products, defects may lead to failure or
            undesirable outcomes in software. Therefore, developers
            should use a model that can provide accurate predictions
            of software defects to identify the defective models in
            the early development stages and rectify them to acquire
            high-quality software. ML classifiers were initially used
            to design software defect prediction models. However,atasets used for software defect prediction comprise
            more nondefective instances than defective instances;
            this result is termed the class imbalance problem.
            Furthermore, various studies on defect prediction models
            have confirmed that approximately 80% of defects are
            observed in limited modules (approximately 20%), which
            indicates that minority classes host more instances
            of defects than non-defective majority classes. Thus,
            applying ML techniques to such imbalanced data leads
            to biased results of minority class instances. Therefore, to
            effectively handle an imbalance in datasets, oversampling
            methods have been employed. A paper on “Efficiency of
            oversampling methods for enhancing software defect
            prediction by using imbalanced data” implemented five
            oversampling techniques to balance the imbalanced
            data and five ML classifiers to develop a defect prediction
            model. The oversampling techniques used are random
            over sampler, synthetic minority oversampling technique
            (SMOTE), adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN), SL-SM,
            and SVM-SOMTE. The ML classifiers implemented are
            decision tree classifiers-j48- classifier, random forest
            (RF) classifier, NaïveBayes (NB) classifier, and ensemble
            Existing Software with quality metrics

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Outcome:</h2>
            <p>The study has investigated whether the performance of
                defect prediction models improved when the datasets
                were balanced. It used five oversampling methods,
                ROS, SMOTE, ADASYN, SL-SMOTE, and SVM-SMOTE, to
                overcome the class imbalance problem. Five ML classifiers
                were used to develop the defect prediction models: J48,
                random forest, Naïve Bayes, AB, and BG. When the datasets
                were balanced, the ML classifiers were used to develop
                defect prediction models. The results were analyzed by
                evaluating the accuracy of defect prediction models
                for the ML classifiers and oversampling methods. The
                performance of oversampling methods was compared to
                identify the optimum oversampling technique.
                The following are the main findings of our study. First,
                balancing the data by using oversampling methods
                enhanced the prediction capability of defect prediction
                models: A considerable increase in the performance
                of the ML classifiers was observed when oversampling
                techniques were used to overcome the data imbalance
                problem. When various oversampling methods were
                used to balance the datasets, the capability of the ML
                classifiers to predict the defectiveness in software
                increased to as high as 80%. SVM-SMOTE was the optimal
                oversampling method because of the capability of SVMSMOTE to synthesize minority class instances in a safe
                region bounded by support vectors. Furthermore, SMOTE
                and ADASYN oversampling performed well. Hence, the
                analysis of this study can be used by researchers working
                in the defect prediction domain.
