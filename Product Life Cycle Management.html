            <p><span class="sub-heading">Introduction to PLM:</span></p>
            <p>PLM stands for Product Life Cycle Management. PLM is the domain that manages the data or information related to the product right from the market needs to end-to-end life cycle of the product.</p>

            <p><span class="sub-heading">Types of Data:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Product Data</li>
                <li>Process Data</li>
                <li>Product Data: What to do?</li>
                <li>Process Data: How to do it?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example: Cooking. Before cooking, the chef should know
                what the correct ingredients are to prepare the dish.
                Without the knowledge of what product data and what is
                process data, if the chef prepares food, then definitely the
                outcome would be unfavorable.</p>
            <p>Similarly, when a company XYZ is going to design car,
                they should deal with product and process data.
                </p>
            <p>Let’s say my company has launched a Car C1 and soon
                they decided to launch C2. The initially launched car
                should undergo lot of changes to launch C2 variant. This
                would take lot of efforts and time to launch C2 variant.
                
                </p>
            <p>But with PLM we can achieve it through its efficient data
                management tools and software’s very quickly with slight
                changes.
                
                Note: Variant:(Another version of product or something)

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Engineering branches must follow PLM:
            </h2>
        <p>As I’m from IT [Information Technology] field I found PLM
            is the best domain for me. Mostly Mechanical Engineers
            and Computer science engineers have more chances to
            follow PLM approach.</p>
        <p>It is not restricted but whoever interested and an
            enthusiastic person who tries to explore things and
            new learnings can also be a part of this PLM journey.
            Nowadays PLM is trending in almost all known industries
            like Aerospace, Automotive, Machinery, Defense and
            many more.</p>
        <p>I just want to mention some of the tools which are
            necessary in PLM software:</p>
        <p>Teamcenter, SAP, Agile PLM, CAD, CAM but currently
            my proficiency falls in Teamcenter which is a Software
            developed by Siemens.</p>
        <p>SAP and Teamcenter connections will happen through
            T4s gateway which contains BGS and GS services.</p>
        <p>T4s is huge, we can explore lot of things in that. It uses
            TCL [Transaction Control Language] for communication
            purpose.</p>
        <p>We cannot store all the CAD(Computer-Aided-Design)
            data in our local system because the CAD data is huge as
            well as other users cannot access our local data and not
            only, they cannot access but also storage becomes one
            challenging factor
            If we are using PLM tool, we can provide the workflow.
            Using that workflow, we can give the best product to the
            end-user.</p>
        <p>Here comes the topic Workflow. Most of us might heard
            about workflow. In simple words workflow is nothing but
            a flow of process or procedure. Coming to PLM workflow,
            the meaning slightly differs.</p>
        <p>
            A workflow is the process of automating business
            procedures by some rules or procedures. We can attach
            documents, tasks in our workflow and that we can pass
            from one participant to another.</p>
        <p>Teamcenter workflows allow you to manage your product
            data processes. You can create any type of workflow to
            accommodate your business procedures.</p>
        <p>Example for workflow: Let’s say Employee A has filled
            his timesheet, but he need approval from the higher
            authorities. So, the time sheet will not be approved
            directly. There will be some procedure as part of the
            organization they follow, and the employee must follow
            the same procedure for his timesheet approval.</p>
        <p>Firstly, the filled timesheet will be submitted to the HR
            department and the HR department will approve and
            forward it to the respective Team leads and finally the
            team lead will approve it and then goes to the higher
            officials.</p>
        <p>Workflow designer is used to design your workflow and
            end-users use the templates to initiate the workflow
            processes in Teamcenter using workflow viewer.
            </p>
        <p>
            We can check-in and check-out the items by preventing
            it modified by other users.
            
            In PLM tool we can revise the parts and store it in the data
            base</p>
        
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">
                why revise?</h2>
            <p>Let’s see how:

                Vehicle may consist of multiple parts and each part will be
                having sub areas. So, when we are dealing with bulk data
                obviously changes are required for making the product
                more efficient.</p>
            <p>So, data may undergo continues changes for enhancing
                new designs. For Example, we have created one part in
                our Teamcenter tool, after some days the end user is
                having issue with that part, and he want a new change.</p>
            <p>In that case, there is no need to create the part from
                scratch, we can use the revise solution provided by our
                PLM tool.</p>
            <p>What is Revise? Revise is the process of creating the
                revisions of part. Once we create a part, it will be stored in
                the Teamcenter database, whenever the user feels there
                is a change required then he will convey to design team.
                The design team finds the respective part in database,
                and they will revise that part for making changes and the
                revised part becomes the latest revision.
                Not only revision, but we also have multiple features to
                explore. We can see the complete vehicle structure in our
                tool. We can download data, modify the data and upload
                the data as per our business needs.</p>
           

        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">About Teamcenter tool:
            </h2>
            <p>Teamcenter is tool or portal for your organizations
                product information by connecting all who needs to
                collaborate with product knowledge. Connecting with
                PLM, Teamcenter enables you to manage and control
                your product data digitally.
                </p>
            <p>So, Companies digitalize their process for consistent
                adherence.
                </p>
            <p>The data comes from CAD, CAM (Computer-Aided
                Manufacturing) tools is not much easy to view. But with
                Teamcenter lifecycle visualization there is the ability to
                view typical cad format design data in JT file.</p>
            <p>Similarly, the workflow has different stages and modules
                for creating workflow in Teamcenter.</p>
            <p>Teamcenter does data control, document control etc.
            </p>
         <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Check-in and check-outs:</h2>

                <p>Check-out: The check-out functionality locks the item/
                    part in Teamcenter so that only you can modify it, whereas
                    other users are just able to view it</p>  
                <p>Check-in: Check-in functionality removes or releases the
                    lock so that other users can also modify it.</p>
                <p>Document control: In the before era, almost all
                    manufacturing companies were doing their processes
                    by their hand, which means the design data such as
                    blueprints required for manufacturing will be created on
                    paper.</p>
                <p>There was no provision for doing it digitally or
                    electronically. By doing man work there are lot of
                    disadvantages for business. Let’s say the paper has lost
                    due to some reasons, then there is chance for ambiguity
                    to occur.</p>
                <p>So, because of that lot of design error will happen and
                    efficiency will be reduced</p>
                <p>But our Teamcenter tool does Documentation control, In
                    Teamcenter you can view any type of document whether
                    it is word, excel, pdf, text file or anything. We can attach
                    documents to workflows also.</p>
                <p>We can apply check-in and check-outs also when we are
                    working with documents if you are concerned about data
                    mismatch.
                    </p>

                Security:</h2>
                <p>PLM plays a very crucial role in maintaining the reliability
                    and security.</p>
                <p>In the Organization, with group user and roles- If a part is
                    owned by one user, the same part cannot be accessed by
                    another user.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, preferences are maintained as a part of security.
                    Administrators can restrict some modules in Teamcenter
                    by handling the preferences.</p>
                <p>
                    Preferences are editable and admins can import or
                    export them into local drives when they are editing the
                    preference values.</p>
                <p>There are some access rights that stops the other user
                    from accessing that part from the part owner. Those
                    access rights will be maintained in the access manager
                    module provided by Teamcenter tool</p>
                <p>
                    Once the part owner is left, the ownership of that part can
                    be transferred to the other user.</p>
                <p>
                    These kinds of actions will be handled by the
                    Administrators. Already in the above section I have
                    explained about check-in and check-out concepts which
                    will help us maintaining data in secure manner.</p>

        
                <p>On top of Teamcenter, the developers can
                    customize the tool as per business needs.
                    For customizing the business processes there are some
                    standards followed by every organization.</p>
          
                <p>For e.g.: Let’s say manual process is time consuming, then
                    developer tries to automate it using the customizations. As
                    experienced, I will try to add few points on customization
                    side for basic idea.</p>
           
         
                <p>As I have explained above about huge data like CAD data,
                    BOM (Bill of Material) data, we can feel it will take time
                    to load sometimes then we must deal with patience. At
                    times we can customize using commands.</p>

            <p><span class="sub-heading">Conclusion:</span></p>
            <p>Hereby I conclude that PLM is a business solution which ensures that the right information should be available to the right people with the right context at the right time. In today's Global Manufacturing Environment, proper utilization of assets is crucial. PLM connects people, Information, Processes, data. It helps in reusing the life cycle knowledge at the development phase. PLM is, therefore, treated as the backbone of the company.</p>
