        <h2 class="sub-heading">Introdution</h2>
         <p>IT service management -- often referred to as ITSM -- is
            simply how IT teams manage the end-to-end delivery of
            IT services to customers. This includes all the processes
            and activities to design, create, deliver, and support IT
            services.</p>
         <p>The core concept of ITSM is the belief that IT should
            be delivered as a service. A typical ITSM scenario could
            involve asking for new hardware like a laptop. You would
            submit your request through a portal, filling out a ticket
            with all relevant information, and kicking off a repeatable
            workflow.
            </p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">The importance of ITSM</h2>
        
        <p>ITSM benefits your IT team, and service management
            principles can improve your entire organization. ITSM
            leads to efficiency and productivity gains. A structured
            approach to service management also brings IT into
            alignment with business goals, standardizing the delivery
            of services based on budgets, resources, and results.
            It reduces costs and risks, and ultimately improves the
            customer experience.</p>
            <h3>Benefits of ITSM to include</h3>
            <p>Aligning IT teams with business priorities tracked
                through success metrics</p>
            <p>Enabling cross-department collaboration</p>
            <p>Bringing IT teams and development teams
                together through streamlined project management
                approaches</p>
            <p>Empowering IT teams to share knowledge and
                continuously improve
                </p>
            <p>Improving request coordination for more efficient
                service</p>
            <p>Promoting customer-eccentricity with self-service
                and better processes</p>
            <p>Responding more quickly to major incidents, and
                preventing future ones</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">ITSM processes</h2>
        
        <p>What are ITSM processes? IT service teams use
            organizational resources and follow repeatable
            procedures to deliver consistent, efficient service.
            A few of the core ITSM processes include:</p>

            <p><b>Service Request Management</b></p>
                <p>Service request management is a repeatable procedure
                    for handling the wide variety of customer service
                    requests, like requests for access to applications,
                    software enhancements, and hardware updates.While
                    there are some variations in the way a service request
                    can be captured and fulfilled, it’s important to focus
                    on driving standardization to improve overall service
                    quality and efficiency. The following process represents
                    a simple request fulfillment process based on ITIL
                    recommendations. This can be used as a starting point
                    for adapting existing ITIL processes or defining new ones.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Knowledge Management</h2>
        <p>Knowledge management is the process of creating,
            sharing, using, and managing the knowledge and
            information of an organization</p>
        <p><b>What is Service Knowledge Management</b></p>
        <p>The Service Knowledge Management System (SKMS) is the
            central repository of the data, information, and knowledge
            that the IT organization needs to manage the lifecycle
            of its services.The SKMS is not necessarily to be a single
            system and usually formed by merging multiple discrete
            
            systems & data sources.The main purpose of SKMS is to
            store, analyze and present the service provider’s data,
            information and knowledge in a structured manner.
            
            The SKMS is closely related to CMDB, KEDB, and CMS.
            These act as three levels of data processing.The CMDB
            captures & record the configuration data and KEDB
            Records Known errors, the CMS arranges these records
            in a manageable structure and then that processed
            information feeds into the SKMS.Using these stored
            information SKMS supports delivery of the services and
            helps to provide relevant information for decision-making.
            Below Image describes the relationship among them:</p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">IT Asset Management</h2>
        <p>IT Asset Management (ITAM) is the practice that helps your
            organization manage, control, and protect its IT assets
            and the IT services that use them. Done well, ITAM will
            help your organization increase value, support decision
            making, control costs, and effectively manage risks.
            ITAM isn’t just about hardware or software, and the new
            ITIL 4 guidance reflects this. When setting the scope
            for your organization’s ITAM capabilities, you’ll need to
            consider networking, cloud-based services, and client
            devices in addition to corporate hardware and software.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>Network infrastructure – routers, hubs, and switches</p>
        <p>Cloud services – Software As A Service (SaaS)
            offerings such as Office 365 or G-Suite, Platform As
            A Service (PaaS) offerings such as Microsoft Azure,
            and Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS) offerings such
            as Amazon Web Services or Google Compute Engine</p>
        <p>Client devices – employee personal devices that can
            access company systems and information.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Incident Management</h2>
        <p>Incident management is the process to respond to an
            unplanned event or service interruption and restore the
            service to its operational state.
            Steps in the IT incident management process</p>
        <p><b>Identify an incident and log it</b></p>
        <p>An incident can come from anywhere: an employee, a
            customer, a vendor, monitoring systems. No matter the
            source, the first two steps are simple: someone identifies
            an incident, then someone logs it. These incident logs
            (i.e., tickets) typically include:</p>
            <p>The name of the person reporting the incident</p>
            <p>The date and time the incident is reported</p>
            <p>A description of the incident (what is down or not
                working properly)</p>
            <p>A unique identification number assigned to the
                incident, for tracking</p>
            <p><b>Categorize</b></p>
            <p>Assign a logical, intuitive category (and subcategory, as
                needed) to every incident. This helps you analyze your
                data for trends and patterns, which is a critical part of
                effective problem management and preventing future
                incidents.
                </p>
            <p><b>Prioritize</b></p>
            <p>Every incident must be prioritized. Start by assessing
                its impact on the business, the number of people who
                will be impacted, any applicable SLAs, as well as the
                potential financial, security, and compliance implications
                of the incident. Compare this incident to all other open
                incidents to determine its relative priority. As a best
                practice, define your severity and priority levels before an
                incident happens, making it simpler for incident managers
                to gauge priority quickly.
                </p>
            <p><b>Respond</b></p>
            <p>Initial diagnosis: Ideally, your front-line support team can
                see an incident through from diagnosis through close,
                but if they can’t, the next step is to log all the pertinent
                information and escalate to the next tier team.</p>
            <p><b>Escalate</b></p>
            <p>The next team takes the logged data and
                continues with the diagnosis process, and, if this next team can’t diagnose the incident, it escalates to the next
                team.
              </p>
            <p><b>Communicate</b></p>
            <p>The team regularly shares updates with
                impacted internal and external stakeholders.</p>
            <p><b>Investigation and diagnosis</b></p>
            <p>This continues on until the
                nature of the incident is identified. Sometimes teams
                bring in outside resources or other department members
                in to consult and assist with the resolution.</p>
            <p><b>Resolution and recovery</b></p>
            <p>In this step, the team arrives at
                a diagnosis and performs the necessary steps to resolve
                the incident. Recovery simply implies the amount of
                time it may take for operations to be fully restored, since
                some fixes (like bug patches, etc.) may require testing and
                deployment even after the proper resolution has been
                identified.</p>
            <p><b>Closure</b></p>
            <p>If the incident was escalated, it is finally passed
                back to the service desk to be closed. To maintain
                quality and ensure a smooth process, only service desk
                employees are allowed to close incidents, and the incident
                owner should check with the person who reported the
                incident to confirm that the resolution is satisfactory and
                the incident can, in fact, be closed.</p>
        
    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Problem Management</h2>
        <p>Problem management is the process of identifying
            and managing the root causes of incidents on an IT
            service.Problem management process can keep repeat
            incidents from happening and stop critical incidents from
            happening in the first place. It is a core component of
            ITSM frameworks.</p>
        <p><b>What is the problem management process</b></p>
        <p>Problem detection - Proactively find problems so they
            can be fixed, or identify workarounds before future
            incidents happen.</p>
        <p><b>Categorization and prioritization</b></p>
        <p>Track and assess known problems to keep teams organized and
            working on the most relevant and high-value problems
            .</p>
        <p><b>Investigation and diagnosis</b></p>
        <p>Identify the underlying
        contributing causes of the problem and the best course
        of action for remediation.</p>
        <p><b>Create a known error record</b></p>
        <p>In ITIL, a known error
            is “a problem that has a documented root cause and a
            workaround.” Recording this information leads to less
            downtime if the problem triggers an incident. This is
            typically stored in a document called a known error
            database.</p>
        <p><b>Create a workaround, if necessary</b></p>
        <p>A workaround is a
            temporary solution for reducing the impact of problems
            and keeping them from becoming incidents. These aren’t
            ideal, but they can limit business impact and avoid a
            customer-facing incident if the problem can’t be easily
            identified and eliminated.</p>
        <p><b>Resolve and close the problem</b></p>
        <p>A closed problem is
            one that has been eliminated and can no longer cause
            another incident.</p>
        <p><b>Change Management</b></p>
        <p>Change management ensures standard procedures are
            used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes to
            IT infrastructure, whether it is rolling out new services,
            managing existing ones, or resolving problems in the
            code.</p>
        <p><b>Types of changes</b></p>
        <p>ITIL defines three types of changes.</p>
        <p><b>Standard changes</b></p>
        <p>Standard changes are low-risk, commonly repeated, and
            pre-approved. They’re performed frequently and follow a
            documented, approved process.
            
            There are multiple tools used in different organizations.
            Some of tools include Service Now, ITSM (IT service
            Manager), HPSM (Hewlett Packard Enterprise Service
            Manager) etc, Axios Systems Assyst, BMC Remedy.
            
            For example, adding memory or storage is a standard
            change. Replacing a failing router with an identical
            working router is a standard change. Creating a new
            instance of a database is a standard change
            For many companies, standard changes are a prime
            opportunity for automation. Some companies report that
            as many as 70% of standard changes can be automated—
            freeing up their teams to focus on normal and emergency
            changes.</p>
        <p><b>Normal changes</b></p>
        <p>Normal changes are non-emergency changes that don’t
            have a defined, pre-approved process.
            For example, upgrading to a new content management
            system is a normal change. Migrating to a new data
            center is a normal change. Performance improvements
            are normal changes. They’re not standard and repeatable.
            There are risks involved. But they’re also not emergencies.
            Which means they can go into the usual change
            management queue for risk assessment and approval.</p>
        <p><b>Emergency changes</b></p>
        <p>These changes arise from an unexpected error or threat
            and need to be addressed immediately—usually to restore
            service for customers or employees or secure systems
            against a threat.
            For example, implementing a security patch is an
            emergency change. Dealing with a server outage is an
            emergency change. Resolving a major incident is an
            emergency change.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>ITSM helps organizations to be more reliable, improve
                    customer satisfaction, optimise service delivery, gain
                    greater visibility of IT costs and assets, become more
                    adaptable.
                    The implementation of ITSM standards provides
                    organizations with the opportunity to differentiate their
                    business and service offerings from their competitors.
                    To be successful, an organization must make an honest
                    assessment of its current position and use this as the basis
                    for planning its future achievements.</p>
