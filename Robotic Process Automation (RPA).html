        <h2 class="sub-heading">Why RPA?</h2>
        <p>What is the use of this new technology? What is the solution for implementing valuable business processes and repetitive tasks that need to be automated to reduce human work and avoid the mistakes humans make due to hectic schedules and multiple tasks they have been assigned to do? The Best and most low-cost solution for this is Robotic Process automation (RPA). This term was coined in 2012 by pat Geary, the chief evangelist for Blue prism. "RPA" this term stands for Robotic Process automation in. The term "Robotic" refers to a software-based bot or robot that may automate repetitive operations that require a great deal of time for humans to complete. The term "process" refers to tasks that can be automated through the use of bots. Therefore, according to its definition, Robotic Process automation is software or a tool that may interact with Graphic user interface (GUI) or user interface (UI) elements to automate repetitive business operations based on human-defined criteria.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">RPA Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Uipath studio: Bots can be implemented using this component.</li>
            <li>Code free: Bots can be programmed with minimal code.</li>
            <li>Workflow center: The platform where users can schedule their bots or trigger them.</li>
            <li>Rules-based execution: RPA bots can perform tasks based on rules defined by humans and when any error occurs, it can get handled, and a notification can be sent to humans monitoring them.</li>
            <li>Cognitive capabilities: RPA and AI can be integrated, which helps develop intelligent bots that can automate more creative tasks.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Types of RPA</h2>
        <p>There are mainly three types of RPA:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attended RPA:</strong> This bot needs human to monitor or supervise them and observe the process that was automated using a bot.</li>
            <li><strong>Unattended RPA:</strong> This bot does not need humans to monitor or supervise them.</li>
            <li><strong>Intelligent Process Automation or IPA:</strong> Future implementation of intelligent bots that feature a human-like interface for business users.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">How RPA Works</h2>
        <p>RPA works by using UI elements to interact with high-level applications. A workflow will be programmed using drag-and-drop activities that click, write, and extract data. No coding is needed, and multiple workflows can be called into one another to avoid confusion in the script. Each workflow will contain some tasks, which is the part of the process that needs to be automated, and for processes where coding is required C#, can be used as a programming language. RPA interacts with the UI-based elements embedded in different layers of applications or software to capture the data and perform the tasks specific to those elements. It works as a human interacting with computer applications to complete business processes.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Tools for Implementing Robots</h2>
        <p>Uipath studio, Automation Anywhere, and Blue Prism are the trending tools for RPA, and Uipath is the most popular among them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Overview of UiPath Studio</h2>
        <p>It is a tool developed by UiPath software company to implement RPA bots that automate business processes and interact with other software such as CRM or ERP software. It has several sophisticated features, including document understanding to process different types of documents and extract data from them and an action center feature to help stop the process when human approval is required. In addition, a test suite feature to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the automated process before it is made public.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The outcomes for RPA should improve as AI develops. Future implementation of intelligent bots, which feature a human-like interface for business users, will allow RPA to reach a wider audience. Guy Kirkwood, the chief evangelist of UiPath, asserts that RPA will serve as the central hub for automation.</p>
