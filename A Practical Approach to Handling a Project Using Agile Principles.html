            <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Managing any project efficiently requires careful planning, thoughtful architecture, and effective
                implementation. This article will explore a practical approach to building a student management system,
                utilizing agile principles for a more iterative and adaptable development process. The project’s example
                will serve as a reference throughout the article.</p>

            <p>Example: Building a Student Management System</p>
        </div>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">
                Requirements Gathering and Use Cases:</h2>
            <p>The first step in any project is to gather requirements and brainstorm use cases. For a student
                management system, it is essential to understand the existing processes within the university or
                college. This might involve interviewing key stakeholders, such as clerks, the Head of Department (HOD),
                and principals, to comprehend the workflow and approval processes.</p>
            <p>To visualize and document these processes, a process mapping diagram with swimlanes can be used. This
                will help identify bottlenecks, improvement areas, and a clear understanding of how the system should
                function.</p>
            <p>Next, to capture the user needs effectively, create user stories. User stories should be concise,
                describing a single functionality from the user’s perspective, regardless of their role. Keeping them
                small makes it easier to manage and prioritize tasks throughout the development process.</p>
            <p>The most basic user stories indispensable to the system’s functionality should be included in the first
                release. Prioritize them over other features to ensure a minimum viable product (MVP) is delivered early
                on. This approach aligns with the Agile development philosophy of incremental progress and continuous
                improvement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Architecture</h2>
            <p>Having a well-defined architecture is crucial to ensure scalability, maintainability, and efficiency of
                the student management system. The architecture of the given case study is depicted in Fig. 1. In this
                example, we will consider the following components for the architecture:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Frontend:</b> Angular - Angular is a popular frontend framework based on TypeScript and CSS,
                    providing a
                    robust and modular structure for building responsive user interfaces.</li>
                <li><b>Backend:</b> Java Microservices - Microservices architecture allows breaking down the application
                    into
                    smaller, independent services, enabling easier development, testing, and deployment.</li>
                <li><b>Database:</b> A relational database like MySQL can be used for record tracking. For actual
                    storage of
                    student data in JSON format, MongoDB, a NoSQL database, can be utilized for its flexibility and
                    scalability.</li>
                <li><b>Deployment:</b> Docker - Docker containers provide an isolated and consistent environment for deploying
                    applications, making it easier to manage and scale the system efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The choice between on-premise or cloud deployment should also be based on budget, scalability
                requirements, and the organization’s policies.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Implementation</h2>
            <p>Before diving into coding, assessing if any existing solutions can be readily integrated to fulfill
                specific requirements is crucial. For example, integrating Google Sign-In or Azure Sign-In could be
                viable options for student authentication. These services offer secure and user-friendly authentication
                methods at minimal costs, saving development time and resources.</p>
            <p>Adopting an agile approach should divide the implementation phase into short iterations or sprints, where
                specific user stories are developed and tested within each sprint. This iterative process enables the
                team to receive feedback from stakeholders regularly and make necessary adjustments throughout the
                project’s lifecycle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Handling a student management system project requires a systematic and agile approach to ensure
                completion. The team gains clarity on the project’s scope by gathering requirements, mapping processes,
                and creating user stories. The chosen architecture ensures a scalable and efficient system, including
                Angular for the front end, Java microservices for the backend, and MySQL and MongoDB for databases.
                Leveraging Docker for deployment enables consistency and easy management.</p>
            <p>Moreover, exploring existing solutions for certain functionalities saves time and resources during
                implementation. Following an agile methodology, the team can adapt to changing requirements, receive
                timely feedback, and deliver an effective student management system that meets user needs and
                expectations. Building a student management system exemplifies how a practical approach combined with
                agile principles can lead to successful project outcomes.</p>
