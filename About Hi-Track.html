        <p>Hemp Industry Track or HI-TRACK is an integrated traceability platform specifically built for Hemp industry in Australia, developed by Natsoft Consulting in association with HempGro to address the challenges faced by Hemp growers and regulator in WA. It is designed to bring all the stakeholders on board on common platform to help regulation with data and compliance processes. Digital technologies such as Blockchain, IoT and Machine learning enable much more possibilities and superior data security. It has custom modules for Farmers, DPIRD (regulator) and Seed Testing Agency. Web and Mobile Apps to input and view data at each stage of the crop from seed to offtake process. It provides birds eye view of movement of seed stocks across farms to the regulator to enable.</p>
