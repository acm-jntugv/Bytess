        <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
        
        <p>I have been working in social impact since 2013, my interactions primarily being with social enterprises,
            not-for-profit organizations, and foundations whose areas of interest are sectors aligned with the
            Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many meetings with new or prospective partners begin with
            participants mentioning their academic and professional backgrounds. It is always interesting to hear
            from people about their different paths; it is not unusual for those who have studied STEM and social
            sciences to work alongside one another on a single project.
            My academic and career path has often invited several questions – after completing an engineering
            degree in Computer Science, I worked in IT for three years before earning a Master of Arts degree in
            International Relations to build a career in development/social impact. I felt that my strengths lay in this
            direction and that working in application support in an IT company was not doing either of us justice.
            As a technology degree and an arts degree seem to have no connection with each other, to most people
            (including myself as I made the transition), there did not seem to be much overlap between the two.
            However, there is much more awareness of the use of technology in development now, especially
            with the rise of initiatives such as ICT4Dev and AI for Good. The need for appropriate technology in
            development/social impact programs is being increasingly put at the center of conversations, more so
            since the COVID-19 pandemic. India is also home to many social enterprises that employ technology as
            a critical part of their offerings – examples of solutions include improving access to primary healthcare
            through digital services, strengthening agriculture value chains, climate change management, better
            disaster resilience, and so on.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">background:</h2>
            <p>I had previously heard the word ‘systems’ only in the
                context of computing. We studied Operating Systems and
                Database Management Systems or thought of the devices
                we worked on as intricate systems that worked magic
                with their components, visible and invisible. Likewise,
                a ‘program’ was for computing, and ‘development’ was
                related to IT projects.</p>
            <p>However, I use these terms in entirely different settings
                now. In social impact, the focus is on sectors closely
                aligned with creating better lives for people, especially
                those who are marginalized. There are several definitions
                for social impact, but the key idea is about addressing
                social and development challenges1. Working towards
                positive social impact requires coordinated action across
                many stakeholders in complex systems. This involves
                the application of a wide variety of skill sets – business,
                technology, human resources, arts, and architecture –
                beyond the usual suspects.
                </p>
                </p>
            <p>In the following few pages, I will share a few examples of
                technology’s critical role in social impact. While it is not
                the obvious career choice for technology professionals,
                it holds much promise for those looking to apply their
                skills in development programs for social change, be it
                engineering, coding, or data science.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Technology for impact:</h2>
        
        <p>
            In the past four years, I have been working in programs
            that aim to make cities better places to live in, mainly to
            improve young people’s well-being. Cities being complex
            systems, improving well-being requires the collaboration
            of several stakeholders with the target population:
            government, non-profit organizations, community-based
            organizations, and private sector companies. Each group
            brings its strengths and knowledge into the mix, applying
            them to address specific social challenges.
            </p>
            
            <p>Let us pause for a moment and think about well-being.
                What do we think of when we imagine a better city?
                Improved infrastructure (lighting, roads, water, sanitation,
                and transport), education systems (schools and colleges),
                healthcare facilities (clinics and hospitals), public spaces
                (parks and libraries), and so on. Building, maintaining, and
                improving these complex systems calls for proven methods
                to work well and constant innovation to find the most
                sustainable ways for better access and longevity. In this
                respect, the use of technology is rapidly gaining traction in
                several sectors. Here, I share a few examples that deal with
                the application of technology in development.
                </p>

                   <b>Decision-making</b> The increasing focus on Smart Cities2 has highlighted
                    the need for data-driven decision-making and its
                    various applications. At a systems level, data can help
                    address some critical challenges related to safety and
                    infrastructure. Machine learning can be applied to analyze
                    safety parameters from city data and allows combinations
                    with other data to produce recommendations for city
                    governments to make cities safer3. Another example is
                    the use of GIS tools that can contribute to planning and
                    implementing interventions to manage climate change
                    effects, even at the city level.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Program monitoring and evaluation:</h2>
<p>Development programs can be spread out over a long
    term, given the nature of the work and the inherent
    complexities of the processes involved. However, it is
    vital to keep evaluating programs at every level for fidelity
    to the objectives and to ensure that data gathered from
    different stakeholders, including the target population,
    contribute to program design and iterations. To this
    end, program funders seek to employ technology in
    various forms to improve the participation of the target
    population in cases where they are otherwise restricted to
    being ‘beneficiaries.’ The means to achieve this can range
    from encouraging simple video documentation through
    smartphones to capturing data sets that can be analyzed
    using AI algorithms for sensemaking, yielding results that
    can be fed meaningfully back into the programs.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Last-mile access:</h2>
        <p>The negative impact of the physical distancing restrictions
            of COVID-19 lockdowns is well known – access to
            healthcare, employment, education, etc., was severely
            affected, particularly for those with limited access to the
            internet for remote solutions. However, the rise in digital
            tools has meant that some efforts could be made to reach
            low-income communities through customized methods.
            Home-learning programs using feature phones5 and
            content delivered through IVRS messages helped engage
            students to a certain extent, as did access to healthcare,
            including mental health specialists, through online services
            and chatbots.
            </p>
        <p>The examples above serve as a reminder of the potential
            for integrating technology into development programs
            and engaging technology professionals in career paths
            beyond those they may be accustomed to exploring.
            Naturally, responsible and safe use of technology is
            critical, and people who have specialized in different
            areas must share learning to improve the application of
            technology for positive social impact. Multidisciplinary
            specialization adds value to such programs, and it would
            be highly encouraging to see institutions and development
            practitioners actively explore how such cross-learning can
            be made possible.
