        <div class="content">
            <p>Robotic process automation (RPA) is a technology that mimics the way humans interact with software to perform high-volume, repeatable tasks. RPA technology creates software programs or bots that can log into applications, enter data, calculate and complete tasks, and copy data between applications or workflow as required.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">How does RPA work?</h2>
            <p>RPA mirrors the way people are accustomed to interacting with and thinking about software applications. RPA's ability to copy the way humans perform a computer-based process has contributed to its popularity compared with automation tools such as application programming interfaces (APIs) or low-code development that are more scalable but less intuitive or require expert knowledge to use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">What are the benefits of RPA?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Enabling better customer service</li>
                <li>Ensuring business operations and processes comply with regulations and compliance standards</li>
                <li>Dramatically speeding up processing time</li>
                <li>Improving efficiency by digitizing and auditing process data</li>
                <li>Reducing costs by reducing manual and repetitive tasks</li>
                <li>Enabling employees to be more productive</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">What are the challenges of RPA?</h2>
            <p>There are a number of challenges related to RPA, which have limited its use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scalability: Enterprises have struggled to scale RPA
                    automation initiatives because, although RPA’s
                    software bots are relatively easy to implement, they
                    can be hard to govern and manage and therefore
                    hard to scale.
                    </li>
                <li>Limited abilities: While its name includes the words
                    “process automation,” many critics have pointed out
                    that RPA software tools automate tasks. More work
                    is often required to stitch multiple tasks together
                    into a process. Craig Le Clair, an analyst at Forrester
                    Research, has cautioned enterprises to observe the
                    “Rule of Five” in building RPA applications because
                    they tend to break when a bot must make more than
                    five decisions, manipulate more than five apps or
                    make more than 500 clicks.</li>
                <li>Security: RPA bots sometimes need to access
                    sensitive information to complete their tasks. If they
                    are compromised, they pose an additional security
                    risk for firms.</li>
                <li>Limited resiliency. RPA failures can occur when
                    applications change in ways that are not anticipated
                    by developers.</li>
                <li>New QA issues. Bots require a variety of new QA
                    practices to ensure they continue to work as intended.</li>
                <li>Privacy: Bots may be involved in working with
                    personally identifiable information governed by
                    privacy requirements. Teams need to ensure this
                    data is processed in conformance with local data
                    protection laws such as GDPR. For example, if an RPA
                    bot moved data outside of a given country without
                    encryption that would be a violation of Article 44 of
                    GDPR. RPA vendors are starting to seek ISO 27701
                    certification as a foundation for managing sensitive
                    information.</li>
                <li>Efficiency: RPA bots manually plod through an
                    application in the same way a human does. This
                    may not be as efficient as automating applications
                    through APIs or workflow automations baked into the
                    application itself.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Applications of RPA</h2>
            <p>Some of the top applications of RPA include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer service:RPA helps companies provide
                    better customer service by automating contact center
                    tasks, including verifying e-signatures, uploading
                    scanned documents and verifying information for
                    automatic approvals or rejections.</li>
                <li>Accounting: Organizations use RPA for general
                    accounting, operational accounting, transactional
                    reporting and budgeting.</li>
                <li>Financial services. Companies in the financial services
                    industry use RPA for foreign exchange payments,
                    automating account openings and closings, managing
                    audit requests and processing insurance claims.
                    </li>
                <li>Healthcare:Medical organizations use RPA for
                    handling patient records, claims, customer support,
                    account management, billing, reporting and analytics.
                    
                </li>
                <li>Human resources:RPA can automate HR tasks,
                    including onboarding and offboarding, updating
                    employee information and time sheet submission
                    processes.</li>
                <li>Supply chain management:RPA can be used in Supply Chain Management for
                    procurement, automating order processing and payments,
                    monitoring inventory levels and tracking shipments.</li>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">The future of the RPA market is driven by hyper automation</h2>
            <p>A Global Market Insights Inc. report expects the RPA market to reach $5 billion by 2024. The increased adoption of RPA technologies by organizations to enhance their capabilities and performance and boost cost savings are prime reasons for the expected growth of RPA.</p>
            <p>Although RPA has been popular because of its simplicity, enterprises have struggled with scaling implementations. Gartner predicts that in the long run, RPA's growth will be accelerated using hyper automation.</p>
            <p>
                Hyper automation efforts combine RPA with other kinds
                of automation tooling, including low-code and no-code
                development tools, BPM tools and decision engines. IPA
                and cognitive automation modules will make it easier to
                weave AI capabilities into these automations.
                </p>
            <p>Process and task mining will help to identify new
                automations. Other AI governance tools will help
                enterprises manage the overall process for streamlining
                processes in ways that ensure trusted AI.</p>
            <p>
                As hyper automation takes hold, companies will need to
                develop a strategic approach to identifying and generating
                automation opportunities, and then managing the overall
                process across the enterprise. Some organizations have
                established an automation Center of Excellence to
                coordinate and scale automation projects.</p>
            <p>Forrester research has predicted that the collective impact
                of these various types of automation technologies could
                help enterprises save $132 billion in labor value in the U.S.
                alone.</p>
