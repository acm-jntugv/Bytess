        <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hey peeps. I hope everything is well with you. Myself, Deepika: Some people choose this way because they think they can earn money quickly, and some people prefer it because of their passion.</p>
        <p>Sugar is sweet. But, for some, it acts like poison. Salt may add flavor to your food. But, for some people, it may be forbidden. You may like something other than what I like. And I may not like what you want. Every person is different—Differ from a DNA profile is said to be unique for every human being. As a result, what is a better career option for one person may not be for another.</p>
        <p>Every career has benefits and drawbacks. It depends entirely on one’s thinking. For instance, I want to become a government servant, so I may serve the public, as that will provide me with greater satisfaction. I am aware that UPSC has numerous disadvantages and is still straightforward, but I am pleased that I am attempting to reach my objectives. Follow your heart and your passion, and selecting your route, is what I wish to convey.</p>
        <p>A software engineer has to work hard, but there is a limit. I
            know an IAS would have to wake up at night if called upon
            due to some incident. In the case of software, there is
            always a backup team. Earning money has no boundaries.
            You can make more money from your salary, building a
            company, freelancing, outsourcing, etc., whereas in the
            IAS, there is no extra money unless you become corrupt,
            and then you can go to jail. IAS is a service where you
            must work for the country and its people, following
            the rules but not breaking them. Even though there are
            numerous disadvantages to choosing civil service as a
            career, someone who has passed on will choose it.</p>
        <p>The youth are an asset for developing the country. If a
            kid like you chooses someone to serve the nation, it may
            bring about change in the country. It may take a long
            time, but a small impact can change many people’s minds
            and lead to the development of our country. I am not
            encouraging everyone to enter civil service; some people
            who want to pursue this as a career are stepping back for
            various reasons. I want to encourage those people not to
            back down but instead to work hard and strive to achieve
            their goals.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">UPSC Posts and Services</h2>
        <p>UPSC posts for 24 different civil services are filled through the Civil Service Examination (CSE) conducted by Union Public Service Commission. Only a few thousand students can successfully clear this examination out of lakhs of aspirants. The most popular services are the Indian Administrative Services (IAS), Indian Police Services (IPS), Indian Revenue Services (IRS), and Indian Foreign Services (IFS). The allotment of services to successful candidates depends on the rankings obtained in the examination. After getting selected for service, a candidate is appointed to various posts. There are three types of civil services:</p>
        <p>1. All Indian Civil Services</p>
        <p>2. Group A Civil Services</p>
        <p>3. Group B Civil Services.</p>
        <p>And there are different posts under these services. I don’t want to bore you by reading these articles and saying the other posts that come under these services because you can find them on the internet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Challenges and Self-Motivation</h2>
        <p>The journey of a civils aspirant is challenging because one who is preparing for civils may be demotivated and feel stressed because they have to face different people’s opinions. We must be self-motivated daily, and consistency is the key to achieving what we want. An unknown quote says, “Push yourself because no one else is going to do it for you.” The goal is yours, so you must make an effort.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Personal Choice</h2>
        <p>Coming to myself I am just at the beginning of achieving my dream. I don’t know whether I can achieve it, but I will give it a try, and I am happy that at least I am trying to achieve what I want.</p>
        <p>So finally, choose what you want to become and achieve it. Many people around us will say this is not good for you and is not the correct path. Listen to them. Take the good in their words. Don’t get demotivated. End of the day, you must be happy and satisfied with your work, whatever the field in which you like to work.</p>
       
        <p>It is your personal choice. Every person thinks differently.</p>
        <p>So, there is no absolute rule to say that the civil service
            is better than the private sector or that the private sector
            is better than the civil service. It all depends on your
            personal choice and your environmental influences. Both
            or from whatever other angle you think applies to your
            are good options. It would be best if you did what gives
            you more satisfaction – professionally, materialistically,
            personality. Finally, choose the career you want to
            become and try hard to achieve it.</p>
