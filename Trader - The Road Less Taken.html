            <h2 class="sub-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Warren Buffet, the legend, once said: “Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn’t. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate.” Exactly what he said was brilliant, but sadly, just 3% of Indians invest in the stock market, which is a very small percentage of the country’s population. In contrast, in the USA, 55% of the population invests in the stock market. These statistics provide us with a good sense of how the people of India lack financial literacy, which is the most important skill to learn to become wealthy in this modern world.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Background</h2>
            <p>Let’s dig into my background to see how I chose trading as my career. I have always wished to enroll in and continue my post-graduate studies with an MBA in 2020, following the completion of my graduation from the information technology branch. I wanted to do business since I had always desired to, as I always wanted to make or build something on my own so that I could be independent; it will also be challenging for me rather than a routine task. By pursuing an MBA, I can advance my progress toward my objective of starting a business. So, I began looking for reputable universities where I could obtain an MBA. The Indian IIFT (Indian Institute of Foreign Trade) in Delhi and Kolkata and the SIBM (Symbiosis Institute of Business Management) in Pune and Bangalore all interviewed me after I took one of the top entrance exams.</p>
            <p>During my interview preparation, I learned more about finance, economics, and financial markets. Apart from preparing for my interview, in my leisure time, I have read books from different genres, out of which these two stood out for me, such as Rich Dad Poor Dad, Business of the 21st Century, etc. I learned a lot from these books, and I concluded that having a passive income would help me achieve financial independence. As a result, having some basic knowledge of the financial markets, I began learning more about the stock market to generate passive income.</p>
            <p>After learning further, I approached my parents with the idea of investing in the stock market. My parents were at first hesitant about the concept of trading and investing. However, I explained how trading and investing work and how eager I am to pursue them. They were accustomed to the concept of trading, and my father supported me by providing me with a significant amount of money to invest. In my early phases of trading and investing, I did a really good job; at this point, I’ve considered making it my full-time profession. At this point, I received a letter from SIBM (Symbiosis Institute of Business Management) stating that I had cleared my interview and that they had offered me admission into their institution. But I had a strong conviction that I could pursue trading as a full-time career. Then, I had a conversation with my family about the possibility of me trading as a full-time profession. We thoroughly researched the advantages and disadvantages of each option before deciding whether to pursue an MBA or make trading a career. We then concluded that, since the internet had made it feasible, I could learn about the MBA subjects online. I subsequently decided against continuing with my MBA and started trading. I made this decision, and my family and I were thrilled about it. But after people learned about it, they began criticizing me and my dad for considering trading, saying things like “trading is gambling” and “many people have lost their wealth.” However, my entire family is encouraging me to pursue my goals, as I am pretty confident and good at them. I couldn’t imagine doing anything else besides this job, which I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Yeah, I know this is a profession where huge risk is involved, but “The biggest risk is not taking a risk. In a world that’s changing quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks,” as said by the great personality Mark Zuckerberg, which I vouch for.Now let us begin by knowing about the investment and
                how it helps one, in the long run, to become financially
                independent.</p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Investment and Its Importance</h2>
            <p>An asset that aids in wealth building is an investment. The money we earn is partly spent, and the rest is saved for meeting future expenses or as an investment made to create income or capital growth, which is known as an investment.</p>
            <p>One needs to invest to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Earn a return on our idle resources.</li>
                <li>Generate a specified sum of money for a specific goal in life.</li>
                <li>Make provisions for an uncertain future.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If one hadn’t invested, he would be left with only ₹11,52,000, but if he had invested 10 percent of his income annually for 30 years, he would have earned a pile of that amount, which is ₹1,12,95,724 including the amount he had invested.</p>
            <p>The created corpus can be utilized for a variety of reasons, including accumulating money for retirement or a down payment; creating an emergency fund; or meeting particular commitments like paying off loans, covering school costs, or purchasing other assets.</p>
            <p>One of the important reasons why one needs to invest wisely is to meet the cost of inflation.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Stock Market Basics</h2>
            <p>Over time, the cost of necessities, including food, clothing, transportation, rent, and leisure activities, rises; this rise is known as inflation. As a result, we might be able to buy fewer products for the same amount of money.</p>
            <p>The term “stock market” describes many marketplaces where shares of publicly traded firms can be purchased and sold. Such financial transactions happen on authorized exchanges and in over-the-counter (OTC) markets that follow a predetermined set of regulations. Traders in the stock market buy and sell shares on one or more of the stock exchanges that are part of the overall stock market.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="sub-heading">Stock Market and Indices</h2>
            <p><strong>Stock Exchange:</strong> The stock exchange provides a platform for investors to buy and sell securities from each other.</p>
            <p>There are three national-level stock exchanges in India:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) was established in 1875.</li>
                <li>The National Stock Exchange (NSE) was established in 1992.</li>
                <li>Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX), established in 2003.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>What is an Index?</strong> The performance of the entire market is sampled using a limited number of stocks. The term “index” refers to this sample. The price of the stocks chosen for the sample is used to determine this index’s value. The market indices are generally representative figures, and thus stocks will be chosen from multiple sectors.</p>

                    <td>It is the market where existing securities are traded. Here, no fresh capital is raised. The purpose is to give existing securities marketability and liquidity. The demand and supply conditions in the market determine the prices of the securities.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>The management of the company issuing the securities determines the prices at which they are issued.</td>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Fundamental and Technical Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Fundamental Analysis:</strong> Analysts who use the fundamental approach to evaluating stocks primarily examine a company’s financial statements to determine its value. There is an extensive range of information available, including the company’s balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.</p>
            <p><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> Traders who utilize the technical strategy depend on the market’s past actions to forecast future price trends. They utilize graphs and charts to analyze and research data and price information.</p>

We have also looked at some basics of the stock market, the importance of financial literacy, fundamental and technical analysis, and how to start your investment journey.
